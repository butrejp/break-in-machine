still working on this, but the finished product will have a capacity of 128 switches and with any luck it'll be two (or more) times faster than the original 

I'll post the BOM when it's done, if it gets done

TODO:

  Modeling:
    cam
  Other:
    print
    build
    test
    write instructions and bom
    write final license
    
    
high chance the final license is gonna be a modified CC BY-SA, I want people to be able to sell assembled machines so long as they point people towards this repository.
