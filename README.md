# break-in-machine
currently exists as a modification to the Senac Breaker, both hotrodding it and fixing inadequacies with the original design

this is a modification for the Senac Breaker break in machine allowing up to 2000 actuations per minute.

BOM:
6x m3 socket cap screws - 15mm length

2x m3 socket cap screws - 6mm length

8x m3 grub screws, approx 10mm in length

37mm geared motor 


for the geared motor I used the 1000 rpm variant of this one:( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0745VWJ54 ).  
you can pick and choose here, but fast is nice.  everything else is original hardware.

when assembling, use a 6mm or letter B drill to clean up inside the shaft hole.  it doesn't have to be super tight, 

but you can't just run a quarter inch drill through it and expect it to work out.  


the 6x 15mm screws are to hold the motor in

the 2x m3 screws are to hold the cam to the motor.

the 8x m3 grub screws are reinforcement for the pusher plates


depending on the environment you're running it in you might want to strap a fan to it.  I went with a 24v 40mm

fan and attached it to the motor with lock wire.


lets call this beerware for now
