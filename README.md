# break-in-machine

this is a modification for the Senac Breaker break in machine allowing up to 2000 actuations per minute. some day far into the future this will be a complete package.  

The Senac Breaker is available here:

you can see the performance of my modification in this video:

BOM:  
6x m3 socket cap screws - 15mm length  
2x m3 socket cap screws - 6mm length  
8x m3 grub screws, approx 10mm in length  
37mm geared motor 
2x washers (included)  
4x pusher plates (included)  
1x motor plate (included)  
1x cam (included)  

everything else is currently original senac parts  

for the geared motor I used the 1000 rpm variant of this one:( https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0745VWJ54 ).  you can pick and choose here, but fast is nice.  everything else is original hardware.

when assembling, use a 6mm or letter B drill to clean up inside the shaft hole.  it doesn't have to be super tight, but you can't just run a quarter inch drill through it and expect it to work out.  use two of the washers included here to space the bearings from the cam.

older senac machines used 2 different pusher types, more modern ones only use the single pusher.  

the 6x 15mm screws are to hold the motor in  
the 2x m3 screws are to hold the cam to the motor.  
the 8x m3 grub screws are reinforcement for the pusher plates  


depending on the environment you're running it in you might want to strap a fan to it.  I went with a 24v 40mmfan and attached it to the motor with lock wire.
